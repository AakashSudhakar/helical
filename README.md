## The HELiCAL Project

---

The **HELiCAL** project is a bioinformatics-based utility - designed for front-end and command-line usage - for biologists and technologists alike. 

The intent of the project is to provide basic, intermediate, and advanced algorithmic operations for genomic data processing in an optimized and user-friendly manner. 

Through optimized algorithms design, modular programmatic complexity, and accessible code architectures, I aim to produce a full-stack Python application that's open-source and serves an interesting and modern problem space.

**HELiCAL** is created and maintained by _Aakash "Kash" Sudhakar_ (2019).
